There are two ways to solve it.

In settings(cmd + ,), find Run Code Configuration.

There is a tab 'Executor map' and open 'edit in settings.json'.

Then you can see the settings for code-runner extension (executor map).

Change the cpp part into this

"cpp": "cd $dir && g++ -o fileNameWithoutExt *.cpp && ./$fileNameWithoutExt"
This code compiles every cpp file in the current directory, so the header will be included properly.

A problem of this solution is, if there are other cpp files with main(), then it will not be compiled properly.

So you'd better use one folder for one cpp program.
